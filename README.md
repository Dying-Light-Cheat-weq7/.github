## 🧪 What is a Dying Light Cheat?

Dying Light cheats are game-changing mods or external tools that alter core mechanics of the game — health, stamina, XP, inventory, weapons, and more. Whether you’re tired of getting clapped by Volatiles or just want to mess around with unlimited crafting, these cheats have your back.

You’ll get access to all kinds of cracked features — think *God Mode*, *One Hit Kill*, *Unlimited Stamina*, *Duplication Glitch Activator*, *Super Jump*, and more.

## 📦 How to Install Dying Light Cheats

> ⚠️ *Always backup your save files first!*

1. **Turn off antivirus (some flags are false positives due to code injection)**
2. **Launch Dying Light, then the cheat/executor/mod menu tool**
3. **Attach to process ("DyingLightGame.exe") if needed**
4. **Toggle the features you want** — God Mode, XP Boost, etc
5. **Jump into the zombie-infested chaos and flex your powers**

Optional: You can also inject cheat tables via Cheat Engine, but mod menus are way more plug-and-play.

## 🧠 Why Use Cheats in Dying Light?

Let’s be real — Dying Light gets HARD. Nighttime Volatiles, instant-death traps, chasing events... sometimes, you just wanna explore without being hunted 24/7. Cheats unlock the game’s full sandbox potential. Want to fly across rooftops, clone legendary weapons, or test builds without grinding? Mods are the way.

Also, perfect if you’re replaying the game and just wanna have fun without the slow XP grind.
